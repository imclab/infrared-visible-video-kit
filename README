To start, you can use one of the precompiled apps for linux, mac, windows
(tested only on mac for now) and you'll be prompted to select a camera.
Then you'll be prompted to select a second camera. The first should be a
normal camera, the second should be a near infrared camera, which you 
can build by following instructions here:

http://publiclaboratory.org/tool/near-infrared-camera

You should then see an NDVI composite image -- which typically displays
vegetation brightly, and healthy vegetation (that is photosynthesizing)
very brightly. Learn more about NDVI here:

email jeff@publiclaboratory.org with bugs, questions, etc.

Please fork and improve it! Post pictures! Stay in touch!
